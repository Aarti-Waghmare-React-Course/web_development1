✅ JavaScript Variables – Interview Quick Summary

🔹 1. What is a Variable?
A variable is a label used to store a value (e.g., number, string, etc.).
You must declare a variable before using it.


🔹 2. Declaring Variables
Keyword	Description
var	Old way to declare (function-scoped)
let	Modern way (block-scoped) – Recommended
const	Block-scoped constant, must initialize

let name;
var age;
const PI = 3.14; // Must be initialized


🔹 3. Variable Naming Rules
Case-sensitive: Name ≠ name

Can contain: letters, digits, _, $

Must start with: letter, _, or $

No reserved keywords (like if, for, etc.)

Use camelCase by convention:

let userName, myAge, _temp, $value;


🔹 4. Initializing Variables
let message = "Hello";
let x = 10, y = 20;
JS is dynamically typed: type can change at runtime.


let message = "Hello";
message = 100; // Valid, but discouraged


🔹 5. Changing Variables
let status = "Active";
status = "Inactive"; // value changed


🔹 6. Undefined vs. Undeclared
Type	Description
Undefined	Declared but not initialized
Undeclared	Not declared at all

let a;
console.log(a); // undefined

console.log(b); // ReferenceError: b is not defined


🔹 7. Constants (const)
Must be initialized at declaration

Cannot be reassigned

const TAX = 0.18;
TAX = 0.20; // ❌ Error
Convention: Use UPPERCASE for constants like const PORT = 3000;


📌 Best Practices
Prefer let for variables that change.

Use const for values that won’t change.

Avoid using var in modern JavaScript.

Always initialize variables to avoid undefined.
