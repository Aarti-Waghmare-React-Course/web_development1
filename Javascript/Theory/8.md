# 📘 JavaScript Numbers

### 🧠 Summary  
In this tutorial, you’ll learn about **JavaScript number types** and how to use them effectively.

## 📖 Introduction to the JavaScript Number

JavaScript uses the **`number`** type to represent both integers and floating-point values.  
Technically, the JavaScript number type uses the **IEEE-754 format**.

Since **ES2020**, JavaScript also supports a new primitive type — **`bigint`** — representing integers larger than `2^53 – 1`.

To support various types of numbers, JavaScript uses different **number literal formats**.

## 🔢 Integer Numbers

You can declare a variable that holds a decimal integer like this:

```javascript
let counter = 100;
Integers can be represented in multiple formats:

Decimal (Base 10)

Octal (Base 8)

Hexadecimal (Base 16)

⚙️ When you use octal and hexadecimal numbers in arithmetic operations, JavaScript treats them as decimal numbers.


🧮 Octal Numbers (Base 8)
An octal literal starts with the digit 0 followed by digits from 0 to 7.

let num = 071;
console.log(num);
Output:


57
If an octal number contains digits outside 0–7, JavaScript ignores the leading 0 and treats it as a decimal:


let num = 080;
console.log(num);
Output:


80
⚠️ This implicit behavior can cause confusion.
To fix this, ES6 introduced a new octal literal syntax starting with 0o.

Example:
let num = 0o71;
console.log(num);
Output:


57
If you use invalid digits after 0o, JavaScript throws a SyntaxError:


let num = 0o80;
console.log(num);
Error:


SyntaxError: Invalid or unexpected token
💠 Hexadecimal Numbers (Base 16)
Hexadecimal numbers start with 0x or 0X, followed by digits 0–9 and letters a–f.


let num = 0x1a;
console.log(num);
Output:


26
🌊 Floating-Point Numbers
A floating-point literal includes a decimal point and at least one number after it.


let price = 9.99;
let tax = 0.08;
let discount = .05; // valid but not recommended
Exponential (E-notation)
For very large or small numbers, use E-notation — multiplying or dividing by powers of 10.


let amount = 3.14e7;
console.log(amount);
Output:

31400000
The notation 3.14e7 means 3.14 × 10⁷.

Similarly, for small numbers:


let amount = 5e-7;
console.log(amount);
Output:


0.0000005
JavaScript automatically converts floating-point numbers with many zeros into E-notation:


let amount = 0.0000005;
console.log(amount);
Output:
5e-7


⚠️ Floating-Point Precision
Floating-point numbers are accurate up to 17 decimal places.
However, arithmetic operations often produce approximate results due to binary floating-point representation.


let amount = 0.2 + 0.1;
console.log(amount);
Output:
0.30000000000000004


🧱 Big Integers (BigInt)
Introduced in ES2020, the bigint type stores integers larger than 2^53 – 1.

A BigInt literal ends with the character n:

let pageView = 9007199254740991n;
BigInts are useful for working with very large integers that exceed the safe range of regular numbers.


✅ Key Takeaways
JavaScript has one number type for both integers and floats.

Use E-notation for very large or small numbers.

Use BigInt (n suffix) for large integers beyond 2^53 – 1.

Be careful with floating-point arithmetic — results may not be exact.
