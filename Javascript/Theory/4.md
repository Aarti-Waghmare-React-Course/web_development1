🔹 1. Whitespace
Includes: space, tab, newline, carriage return.
Ignored by JS engine, but improves code readability.

let x = 10; // Good
let x=10;if(x){console.log(x);} // Works, but hard to read


🔹 2. Statements
Instructions for the JS engine, usually end with ;

let msg = "Hello";
console.log(msg);
Semicolon is optional but recommended.


🔹 3. Blocks
Group of statements enclosed in {} (used in if, loops, functions, etc.)

if (x > 0) {
  console.log("Positive");
}


🔹 4. Identifiers
Names for variables, functions, etc.

Must begin with a letter, _, or $

Can include letters, digits, _, and $

Case-sensitive: Name ≠ name


🔹 5. Comments
Used for documentation, ignored by JS engine

Single-line: // this is a comment

Multi-line:

/* This is
   a multi-line comment */


🔹 6. Expressions
Code that evaluates to a value

2 + 3     // returns 5
a * b     // returns result of a * b


🔹 7. Keywords
Reserved words that cannot be used as identifiers

Examples:

if, else, function, return, let, var, const, etc.

Future reserved words: enum, await, implements, etc.


✅ Summary Cheat Sheet
Concept	Key Points
Whitespace	Use for readability
Statements	End with ;
Blocks	Use {} to group code
Identifiers	Names for variables/functions; case-sensitive
Comments	// for single-line, /* */ for multi-line
Expressions	Return values (e.g., a + b)
Keywords	Reserved words; avoid using as names


reserved words:
break	case	catch
continue	debugger	default
else	export	extends
function	if	import
new	return	super
throw	try	null
void	while	with
class	delete	finally
in	switch	typeof
yield	const	do
for	instanceof	this
var


future reserved words
enum	implements	let
protected	private	public
await	interface	package
implements	public


Summary
Use whitespace, including carriage return, space, newline, and tab to format the code. The JavaScript engine disregards whitespace.
Use a semicolon (;) to terminate a simple statement.
Use the curly braces ({}) to create a block that groups one or more simple statements.
A single-line comment starts with // followed by text, while a block comment begins with /* and ends with */. The JavaScript engine ignores comments.
Identifiers are names you choose for variables, functions, classes, and so on.
Avoid using reserved keywords for identifiers.
