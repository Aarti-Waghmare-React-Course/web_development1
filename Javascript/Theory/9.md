# 💡 JavaScript Numeric Separator

### 🧠 Summary  
In this tutorial, you’ll learn how to use the **JavaScript numeric separator** to make numeric literals more readable and maintainable.

## 📖 Introduction to the JavaScript Numeric Separator

The **numeric separator (`_`)** allows you to create **visual separation between groups of digits**, improving code readability — especially for large numbers.


### Without Numeric Separator 😵‍💫
When numbers get long, they become hard to read:

const budget = 1000000000;
❓ Is this a billion or a hundred million?


With Numeric Separator 😎
The numeric separator makes it easy to interpret large numbers:

const budget = 1_000_000_000;
✅ Much more readable — you can instantly see this is 1 billion.


🔢 Using Numeric Separators
You can use numeric separators in both integers and floating-point numbers.


let amount = 120_201_123.05; // 120201123.05
let expense = 123_450;       // 123450
let fee = 12345_00;          // 1234500

💬 Note: All numbers in JavaScript are stored as floating-point numbers, even when you use separators.


⚙️ Fractional and Exponent Parts
You can also use numeric separators in fractional and exponent parts of numbers.
let amount = 0.000_001; // 1 millionth

🧱 Numeric Separators with Other Literals
The numeric separator also works with BigInt, binary, octal, and hexadecimal literals.

// BigInt
const max = 9_223_372_036_854_775_807n;

// Binary
let nibbles = 0b1011_0101_0101;

// Octal
let val = 0o1234_5670;

// Hexadecimal
let message = 0xD0_E0_F0;


🏁 Summary
✅ Use underscores (_) as numeric separators to improve readability.
✅ Works with integers, floats, BigInts, and base literals (binary, octal, hex).
✅ Ignored by the JavaScript engine — only affects readability, not value.
